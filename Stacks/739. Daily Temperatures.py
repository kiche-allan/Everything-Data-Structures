# Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
# Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]

class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        stack = []
        res = [0] * len(temperatures)

        for i, t in enumerate(temperatures):
            while stack and stack[-1][0] < temp:
                warmest_day = stack.pop()
                res[warmest_day[1]] = i - warmest_day[1]
            stack.append([t, i])
        return res
